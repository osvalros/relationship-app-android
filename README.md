# RelationshipApp Android
An Android app with features aimed towards me and my girlfriend written in Kotlin. My main reason to create this application (apart from the actual functionality) is to practice Kotlin and some new Android features.

Backend was implemented for this application in [this repository](https://github.com/osvalros/relationship-app-backend-ktor) using Kotlin and Ktor.
